# Acknowledgments

Black Mamba has several bundled packages. Why?

* Not fully working `pip` in Pythonista.
* Pythonista contains some of these packages, but they're outdated (longer release cycle).
* Installation must be as easy as possible (no `pip`, `pip3`, no dependencies).

List of bundled packages:

```eval_rst
.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   docutils
   flake8
   future
