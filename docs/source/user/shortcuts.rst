General
=======

``Cmd 0`` toggles file navigator / library.


Dialogs
=======

You can close all dialogs with ``Esc`` key. If you have a keyboard without
``Esc`` key, you can do it with ``Cmd .``. Dialogs with tables do support
arrow keys to change selection and ``Enter`` key to select item.

Some of these dialogs do support ``Shift Enter`` for an alternate action.
Example is Open Quickly where you can open file in a new tab with ``Enter``
and in the current tab with ``Shift Enter``.


Tabs
====

``Cmd 1`` .. ``Cmd 9`` allows you to quickly switch between tabs.

``Ctrl Tab`` or ``Cmd Shift ]`` selects next tab and
``Ctrl Shift Tab`` or ``Cmd Shift [`` selects previous tab.

``Cmd W`` closes current tab and ``Cmd Shift W`` closes all tabs except
current one.

``Cmd T`` creates new empty tab and ``Cmd N`` shows Pythonista new file
dialog.


Editor
======

``Ctrl UpArrow`` for page up, ``Ctrl DownArrow`` for page down. Page
line count is configurable, see :ref:`configuration`.
