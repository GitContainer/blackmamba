System
======

* iOS >= 10
* iPad w/ external keyboard


External keyboard "is a must". You can use :ref:`scripts` as action items (wrench menu icon),
but it's not as great as with :ref:`shortcuts`.

.. note:: Black Mamba should work on iPhone, but the UI is not optimized
   for this device at all. You can try it, but it's not officially supported
   and never will be.

Continue to :ref:`install`.
