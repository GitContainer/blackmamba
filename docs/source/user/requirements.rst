System
======

* iOS >= 10
* iPad w/ external keyboard


External keyboard "is a must". You can use :ref:`scripts` as action items (wrench menu icon),
but it's not great as with external keyboard.

.. note:: Black Mamba should work on iPhone as well, but the UI is not optimized
   for this device at all. You can try it, but it's not officially supported.

Continue to :ref:`install`.
