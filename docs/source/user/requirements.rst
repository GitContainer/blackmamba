System
======

* iOS >= 10
* iPad w/ external keyboard


External keyboard "is a must". Some of these `scripts <https://github.com/zrzka/blackmamba/tree/master/blackmamba/script>`_
can be used as actions (wrench menu icon), but it's not great as with external keyboard.

.. note:: Black Mamba should work on iPhone as well, but the UI is not optimized
   for this device at all. You can try it, but it's not officially supported.
