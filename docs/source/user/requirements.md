# Requirements

## System

* iOS >= 10
* iPad w/ external keyboard

External keyboard "is a must". You can use [Scripts](scripts.md) as action items (wrench menu icon),
but it's not as great as with [Shortcuts](shortcuts.md).

> Black Mamba should work on iPhone, but the UI is not optimized
> for this device at all. You can try it, but it's not officially supported
> and never will be.
