Bundled packages
================

Black Mamba has several bundled packages. Why?

* Not fully working ``pip`` in Pythonista.
* Pythonista contains some of these packages, but they're outdated (longer release cycle).
* Installation must be as easy as possible (no ``pip``, ``pip3``, no dependencies).
