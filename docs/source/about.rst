About Black Mamba
#################

Black Mamba is Python™ package for `Pythonista <http://omz-software.com/pythonista/>`_
application.

Pythonista is a great tool, seriously. But it lacks some features like keyboard
shortcuts for specific actions. I'm slow without them. So I decided to write
set of scripts to *fix* all these issues. To speed up my iteration cycle. To make
it as fast as possible. And which snake is the speediest one on the planet?
`Black Mamba <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_mamba>`_. And you know
why it's called Black Mamba now :)

For learning how to use Black Mamba, see the :ref:`user`.

For detailed reference documentation of the functions and classes contained in
the package, see the :ref:`reference`.
