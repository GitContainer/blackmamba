# FAQ

## General

### Are you affiliated with Pythonista?

No. It's a completely separate project. Although I discuss some of my ideas
with [Ole](https://twitter.com/olemoritz) (Pythonista author) from time to time.


### What if some feature will be added to Pythonista?

I'm perfectly okay with this and will be happy if something from Black Mamba
will be natively supported by the Pythonista. That's also the reason why I filled
[so many issues](https://github.com/omz/Pythonista-Issues/issues/created_by/zrzka).

These features will be removed from Black Mamba after some period if this happens.
