There are several areas where you can help.


Documentation
=============

I'm not native English speaker and some of my sentences sound weird.
Fork `blackmamba <https://github.com/zrzka/blackmamba>`_ repository,
update `documentation <https://github.com/zrzka/blackmamba/tree/master/docs/source>`_ and
open pull request. Will happily merge it.

Documentation does use `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_.
Here's `quick start <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickstart.html>`_ guide.

Why not Markdown? reStructuredText is more powerful and allows me to use links, references and
other stuff.


Testing
=======

If you find a bug, please do not hesitate to `file an issue <https://github.com/zrzka/blackmamba/issues>`_.
I'm unable to test everything.


Development
===========

Black Mamba is developed in my spare time. I have a full time job, love it and I don't
have much time to enhance it. If you'd like to help, see :ref:`development`.


Questions
=========

Do you have a question? `File an issue <https://github.com/zrzka/blackmamba/issues>`_, I'll add
``question`` tag and will answer it. Or you can send me direct message on
`Twitter <https://twitter.com/robertvojta>`_.
